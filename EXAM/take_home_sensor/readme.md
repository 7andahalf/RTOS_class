# Sensor

Given the problem that time sync at server is not reliable, client will manage the timings. Client will request server to send data every 100ms. The server will first look at last edit of the file, if it is above 50ms and below 1950ms it will bundle the readings with the last edit time and send it to client. The client constantly monitors these packets and when it notices that a new edit has been made, it exracts the data and writes to csv file with timestamp.


# data.csv file generated
The output of the client is as follows

We can clearly notice that the time difference between the timestamps is ~2000ms which is 2 seconds as expected.
